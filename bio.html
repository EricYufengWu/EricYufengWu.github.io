  <h1>Yufeng (Eric) Wu</h1>
  <br/>
  <p>Hi! My name is Yufeng (Eric) Wu, and I am currently a Sophomore at Tufts University at Medford, MA. I am studying in mechanical engineering with a minor in studio art. </p>
  
  <p>This website contains several sections that collectively define who I am. It is still under construction, as I am still refining some documentations of my previous and current projects. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me at yufeng.wu@tufts.edu or 857-869-3542.</p>
