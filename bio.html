    <p>Hi! My name is Yufeng (Eric) Wu, and I am currently a Sophomore at Tufts University at Medford, MA. I am studying in mechanical engineering with a minor in studio art. </p>
    <p>This website contains several sections that collectively define who I am. It is still under construction, as I am still refining some documentations of my previous and current projects. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me at <span class="highlight">yufeng.wu@tufts.edu</span> or <span class="highlight">857-869-3542</span>.</p>
